      <v-card-text>
        <p>We stock over 3000 different rebuilt steering columns...</p>
        <p>
          All Rebuilt steering columns come with two new keys and are painted to
          match the interior of your car. To see the paint colors available

        </p>
        <p>
          Our columns are thoroughly tested. We have a 10 point mechanical and
          electrical quality control test which ensures our customers are
          receiving a perfect column every time.
        </p>
        <p>
          On GM vehicles that are equipped with the V.A.T.S. system (vehicle
          anti theft system) we ship the column with the correct key eliminating
          the need to switch locks.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you prefer or we don't have the column you need in stock we can
          rebuild your column. In most cases the turn around for this service is
          four or five days .

        <p><b>Core Charge:</b></p>
        <p>
          The applicable core charge will be billed to your credit card if you
          do not return the original column from your vehicle within 30 days.
          There are no additonal charges to return the core since you have
          already paid the return shipping when placing your order. If the
          original column has been dismantled, please be sure to include ALL
          pieces. Steering columns that are not the same or have been modified,
          or are missing major components may not be acceptable cores.
        </p>
        <p><b>Return Procedure:</b></p>
        <p>
          After you have installed the column that we shipped you and are
          confident that the column is functioning properly, place the core into
          the box that we shipped you. Please pack the core in the same manner
          that it was delivered, wrapping the bubble wrap around the upper
          portion of the column.
        </p>
        <p><b>Schedule Pickup:</b></p>
        <p>
          Simply place the return-shipping label (which is supplied with your
          order) on the box and give it to any UPS driver or UPS center or call
          1-800-PICKUPS to locate a UPS center near you.
